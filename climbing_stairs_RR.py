        def climb(n):
            if n == 0:
                return 0

                return 1

                return 2

            table = [None] * (n+1) 
            table[0] = 0        # base case 1, fib(0) = 0
            table[1] = 1
            table[2] = 2      # base case 2, fib(1) = 1
            # filling up tabulation table starting from 2 and going upto n
            for i in range(3,n+1):  
                table[i] = table[i-1] + table[i-2]
